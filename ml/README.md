# Chapter 6: Machine learning analysis of clinical data for predicting and exploring preterm birth

This chapter used machine learning to explore the antenatal clinical data from pregnancies at high risk of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) (n=1169).

High risk of sPTB was defined by having â‰¥1 of: a previous sPTB, a previous preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM), a previous miscarriage at 16-23<sup>+6</sup> weeks, a previous destructive cervical surgery, a uterine abnormality, or an incidental finding of a short cervix (cervical length <25mm) in this pregnancy. 

## Predicting pregnancy outcome with random forests
I developed random forest models to predict whether pregnancies would result in term outcomes or preterm outcomes.

Subsequently, I examined which factors were most important in the classification.

## Unsupervised clustering of high risk pregnancies
I examined clustering of these same pregnancies (n=1169) with hierarchical clustering. 

The aims of this analysis were to determine how many clusters were present, how the clusters were characterised, and whether preterm birth rates differed by cluster group.
