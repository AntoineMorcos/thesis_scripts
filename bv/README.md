# Chapter 3: Investigating bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy

This chapter investigated bacterial vaginosis (BV) at two stages in pregnancy: 10<sup>+0</sup> to 15<sup>+6</sup> weeks' gestation and 16<sup>+0</sup> to 24<sup>+0</sup> weeks' gestation.
<br/><br/>

## BV, ethnicity and spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB)
Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to determine associations between BV, at both 10-15 weeks' gestation (N=284) and 16-24 weeks' gestation (N=294), with ethnicity and sPTB.

## BV and microbiota
Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was used to determine which taxa characterised BV (N=28 at 10-15 weeks' gestation, N=29 at 16-24 weeks' gestation) _versus_ normal flora (N=212 at 10-15 weeks' gestation, N=227 at 16-24 weeks' gestation).
<br/><br/>

## BV and metabolites
Metabolites were explored in pregnancy at 10-15 weeks' gestation (N=302) and 16-24 weeks' gestation (N=302) with principal component analysis (PCA). 
Subsequently, associations between BV status and cervicovaginal metabolites were determined with Wilcoxon rank sum tests.
<br/><br/>

## BV and elafin
Lastly, I determined associations between cervicovaginal elafin concentrations with BV status, and the genotypes of four candidate elafin SNPs.
The genotypes of the four candidate elafin SNPs (rs17333103, rs1983649, rs6032040 and rs2664581) were then explored in relation to BV status and sPTB outcomes.
