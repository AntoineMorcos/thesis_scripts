# Chapter 5: Investigating the microbiota network in the cervicovaginal environment of pregnant Black women

This chapter investigated the cervicovaginal microbiota, metabolome and inflammatory markers in pregnant Black women (N=87).

The cervicovaginal swab samples were collected between 10<sup>+0</sup> to 15<sup>+6</sup> weeks' gestation.

The inflammatory markers examined in this study included: 
complements C5 and C5a; 
cytokines IFN-Î³, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13, IL-17A, and IL-22; 
chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1; 
the antibody IgM; 
and the haematopoietic growth factor G-CSF.
<br/><br/>

## Inflammatory markers and spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB)
I explored how cervicovaginal inflammatory marker concentrations varied by sPTB outcome, pH, BMI, ethnicity, and sPTB risk status.
<br/><br/>

## Correlations
I determined correlations within and between the three data layers (immune, metagenome, and metabolome).
<br/><br/>

## Microbiota network
I determined the relationships between cervicovaginal microbiota using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA).

Subsequently, I determined associations between WGCNA module eigengenes and metadata (immune, metabolome, and clinical data).
