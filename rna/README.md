# Chapter 4: Exploring cervicovaginal neutrophils and immune cells in pregnancy

## Cervical immune cell proportions
Cervical immune cell proportions were examined in pregnancy (n=51 cytobrush samples, from N=46 women). 

I examined how proportions varied by pregnancy outcome (term _versus_ preterm), ethnicity, and when the samples was taken in gestation.

The cell types examined included: neutrophils, NK cells, B cells, T cells, and monocytes.

## Cervical neutrophil gene expression and cervicovaginal microbiota 
The gene expression of cervical cytobrush neutrophils were examined in a subset of women (N=10).

Associations between neutrophil gene expression, clinical data, and the relative abundance of cervicovaginal microbiota were explored with weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA).
